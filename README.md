### What I learned

Through this challenge, I gained a better understanding of CSS positioning (absolute, relative), z-index, and background image placement. I also practiced using custom properties, flexbox, and grid to structure the layout effectively. It was a great exercise in creating a clean, responsive component using only HTML and CSS.
